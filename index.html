                        flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.</p>

                        maximum
                        size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.</p>

                            the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.</li>

                            with
                            the flex-direction, then it behaves like end.</li>
                        <li>center: items are centered along the line</li>
                        <li>space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line,

                            that
                            visually the spaces aren't equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The
                            first
                            item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between
                            the
                            next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.</li>
                        <li>space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space
                            to
                            the edges) is equal.</li>

                    <p>The gap property explicitly controls the space between flex items. It applies that spacing only
                        between items not on the outer edges.</p>
                    <p>The behavior could be thought of as a minimum gutter, as if the gutter is bigger somehow (because
                        of
                        something like justify-content: space-between;) then the gap will only take effect if that space
                        would end up smaller.</p>
                    <p>It is not exclusively for flexbox, gap works in grid and multi-column layout as well. </p>

                        order.

                        serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container
                        the

                        as
                        much of the space either one of the others (or it will try, at least).</p>

                        property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content
                        keyword means “size it based on the item's content” - this keyword isn't well supported yet, so
                        it's
                        hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.

                        with a single number value, like flex: 5;, that changes the flex-basis to 0%, so it's like
                        setting
                        flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;.</p>
